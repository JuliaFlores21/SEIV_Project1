            <br>Her second cat is called Mia. She is 3 years old and was rescued from the street with several puppies by a Brazilian non-profit 
            organization called <a class="link" href="https://www.osindefesos.com.br/">Os Indefesos</a> (meaning "the helpless") when she was 1 year old. All the 
            puppies were adopted and because she was an adult, did not have the same success. She spent 2 months waiting inside a cage until her and 
            Julia's family's path met. </p>

            <br>My name is Dustin Ortiz and I am majoring in Computer Science with Cybersecurity. I am one of the Lead IT Technicians 
            at Oklahoma Christian University. I am passionate about information technology and cybersecurity. Not that passionate about
             programming but here I am. Go learn cybersecurity more than programming! </p>

            <br>Hi! I am Julia Flores and am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I started studying Computer Science at Oklahoma Christian University (OC) in 
            Spring 2021 and I am loving it! I am a senior now, I work as an IT Support Technician at OC and am going to get a master
            in Computer Science with Cybersecurity. If I could give a tip for someone who is studying Computer Science, I would say to 
            in addition to doing the assignments proposed by the professors, be interested and seek to carry out personal projects or for 
            extra information. Enriching your knowledge is a valuable tool for the job market.</p>

            <br>Hello! I am Justin Dail and am from Okinawa, Japan. I am studying Computer Science with Cybersecurity at OC since 2019. 
            If there was one thing that I whish I knew before I started studying Computer Science it would be to not be cheap and grab 
            a proper laptop in my freshman year.</p>
