            If there was one thing that I whish I knew before I started studying Computer Science it would be to not be cheap and grab 
            a proper laptop in my freshman year.</h5>

                <h5 class = "left_text">Hi! I am Julia Flores and am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I started studying Computer Science (CS) at Oklahoma Christian University (OC) in 
                Spring 2021 and I am loving it! I am a senior now, I work as an IT Support Technician at OC and am going to get a master 
                in CS with Cybersecurity. If I could give a tip for someone who is studying CS, I would say to 
                in addition to doing the assignments proposed by the professors, be interested and seek to carry out personal projects or for 
                extra information. Enriching your knowledge is a valuable tool for the job market.</h5>
